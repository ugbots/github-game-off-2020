## Build instructions

### Dependencies

These are required to build the game:

- `yarn` (we used v.1.22.5)
- `node` (we used v.10.19.0)

### Running locally

You'll want to run the game locally to be able to build new features, change the
art, etc. The first time you do this, there's some extra setup involved. Follow
these steps:

1. clone this repo somewhere on your machine using `git clone`.
1. Run `yarn install` to fetch dependencies.

After that, every other time you want to run the game just type `yarn dev` to
start the development server.

## Troubleshooting

### The keyboard controls aren't working!

You may have to remove some extensions if you're running Chrome. The evernote
extension is known to cause issues with Phaser's keyboard controls.
