# Ratstronauts
*An Ugly Robot Game* 🤖

Become ratkind's greatest hero!

Launch your spaceship to the moon and eat delicious moon cheese.

This is our entry for the 
[2020 Github Game-off](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2020).

## Build instructions

### Dependencies

These are required to build the game:

- `yarn` (we used v.1.22.5)
- `node` (we used v.10.19.0)

### Running locally

You'll want to run the game locally to be able to build new features, change the
art, etc. The first time you do this, there's some extra setup involved. Follow
these steps:

1. clone this repo somewhere on your machine using `git clone`.
1. Run `yarn install` to fetch dependencies.

After that, every other time you want to run the game just type `yarn dev` to
start the development server.
